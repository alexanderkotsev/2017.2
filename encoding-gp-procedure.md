# Procedure for alternative encodings of INSPIRE data

## Introduction
This procedure describes the approach to be followed for encoding INSPIRE data in accordance with the IR through the use of alternative encodings.

Open Question: Are additional encodings in scope?

## Approach

### Step 1. Data encoding
Data should be encoded through the alternative encoding (e.g. GPKG or GeoJSON) by following the (i) INSPIRE UML models, (ii) model transformation rules and (iii) the encoding-specific rules.

### Step 2. Mapping to the default encoding
Once the data instances are available, mapping to the default INSPIRE encoding (XML) should be provided through at least one of the following means:
- mapping tables
- executable transformation script
- transformation service

### Step 3. 

### Step 4. 

## Update on the glossary
- Additional encoding
- Alternative encoding
- Default encoding
- Model transformation rules
- Encoding-specific rules
